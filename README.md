# C-Test Evaluation App

Diese R Shiny App ermöglicht die Evaluierung von C-Tests als diagnostisches Werkzeug im Deutschunterricht.

Für eine Anleitung auf Deutsch, siehe [hier](https://github.com/thomas-enzlein/cTestEvaluation/blob/main/helpfiles/anleitung.md).

## Overview and Purpose

C-tests are a type of language proficiency assessment composed of several short texts in which the second half of every second word is deleted, requiring the test taker to use language competence to fill in the gaps. They are designed to measure a person's language ability across a wide range of proficiency levels by testing linguistic knowledge and textual competence in an integrated way.

The C-Test Evaluation App is an application designed to assess and evaluate student performance on C-Tests. By comparing student results to set reference values, the application provides actionable recommendations for student support and development. While the recommendations generated by the app serve as initial guidance, educators are encouraged to utilize additional diagnostic tools for a comprehensive evaluation if needed.

## Getting Started

Initiating the evaluation process is straightforward. The primary steps involve:

- Adding Students: Navigate to the "Evaluation" section to enter each student's name along with their respective WE-value and R/F-value. After entering all relevant information, click "Add" to include the data into the overview table. Make sure that the number of test items is adjusted to match the number of completed gaps, and that the correct grade level and class are selected.
- Overview Table: The summary table compiles all entries and provides a clear overview of the recommended actions for each student. To correct any mistaken entries, select the student and use the "Remove" button to delete them.
- Saving Data: Once the evaluation is complete, data can be saved in Word and Excel formats, as well as a *.tsv file for future use.

## Features and Functionality

A left-hand menu (illustrated within the app) allows users to access different features:

- Instructions: A guide on how to utilize the app (in german).
- Evaluation: Where to input and review student data, and save results.
- Statistics: View the average and median R/F and WE values, and visualize the data through histograms.
- Advanced: Access advanced functions for experienced users, such as loading saved data.

## Evaluation and Review

In the "Add Student" subsection, educators can swiftly enter and compile student data, setting up the number of test items and adjusting class settings as required.
The overview table not only summarizes the data but also provides sorting functionality to help educators identify students needing the most support.
